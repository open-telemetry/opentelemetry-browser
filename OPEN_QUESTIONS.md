what semantic attributes?
 - browser.console for event  and browser.console.method for type

secerity for log vs info?
-  INFO = 9?
is the traceparent of active span enough? 
- from my testing that can get disconnected when the frontend was served by the backend and we could use the traceparent from meta tags
